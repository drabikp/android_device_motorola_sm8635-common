# =============================================================================
# HALs BUILT FROM SOURCE
# =============================================================================
# Everything below replaces a Motorola blob with the HAL the platform already
# compiles, following the shape of the official LineageOS device for this same
# SoC (xiaomi/peridot, SM8635, lineage-23.2), which declares ~220 packages and
# builds its HAL services rather than lifting them out of stock.
#
# The concrete defect this fixes, measured on the built image: TEN HAL service
# binaries shipped with NO init .rc at all, so init never started any of them --
#   android.hardware.health-service.qti      android.hardware.usb-service.qti
#   android.hardware.wifi-service            vendor.qti.hardware.memtrack-service
#   vendor.qti.hardware.vibrator.service     ... and five more
# extract_utils generates a cc_prebuilt_binary with no init_rc, so a blob HAL
# only starts if its .rc is ALSO listed in proprietary-files.txt by hand. The
# Soong modules below carry their own init_rc and vintf_fragments, so the .rc
# and the VINTF manifest entry come along automatically and cannot drift out of
# sync with the binary.
#
# Each entry here is paired with the removal of the corresponding line(s) from
# proprietary-files.txt -- adding one without the other gives
# "already defined by an in-tree source module".

# Boot control. Mandatory on A/B, and the first failure ever isolated on this
# device: the blob aborted in bootcontrol_init() because /dev/block/bootdevice
# did not exist, restart-looped, and init gave up at ~328s.
